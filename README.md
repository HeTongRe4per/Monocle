An Iris addon for neoforge that allows Iris to work with Embeddium.

## License
Originally, I was planning on licensing the addon the same as [Iris](https://github.com/IrisShaders/Iris/blob/1.20.3/LICENSE), LGPLv3. 
However, upon further inspection it seems this is "wrong" from Iris. Iris makes use of [glsl-transformer](https://github.com/IrisShaders/glsl-transformer?tab=AGPL-3.0-1-ov-file#readme),
a library licensed as AGPL, which is incompatible with LGPL. As a result, from my understanding, the combined project should be considered AGPL as well. 
Iris is aware of the issue, and is working on resolving it. 

As such, the only valid license I can take is AGPL as well, to be in compliance with glsl-transformer used by both Iris and Monocle.
